#### 1.1 Production Configuration
**File**: `djangotutorial/mysite/settings.py`
**Required Changes**:
- Update `DEBUG` setting to use environment variables properly
- Configure `ALLOWED_HOSTS` for Elastic Beanstalk domains (`.elasticbeanstalk.com` domain)
- Add production security settings
- Configure static files collection
- Set up proper secret key management

#### 1.2 Elastic Beanstalk Configuration Files
**EXISTING CONFIGURATION**:

- **`.ebextensions/04_nginx.config`**: Web server configuration

#### 1.3 Application Entry Point
**Status**: Django WSGI application already configured in `mysite.wsgi:application`

### 2. ELASTIC BEANSTALK SETUP (PHASE 3)

#### 2.1 EB CLI Installation and Configuration
**ALREADY CONFIGURED**:

#### 2.3 Environment Variables Inventory (Required vs Present)
Based on `mysite/settings.py` and deployment practices, the following variables are relevant for production operation:

- Required core variables:
  - `SECRET_KEY` (must be set in EB env)
  - `DEBUG` (should be `False` in production)
  - `ALLOWED_HOSTS` (should include EB domain: `.elasticbeanstalk.com`)

- Optional/when applicable:
  - `RDS_DB_NAME`, `RDS_USERNAME`, `RDS_PASSWORD`, `RDS_HOSTNAME`, `RDS_PORT` (if migrating off SQLite)
  - `AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME`, `AWS_S3_REGION_NAME` (if moving static/media to S3)

Status: Presence/values in the EB environment need to be verified and recorded in README.

### 8. CROSS-DOC GAP ANALYSIS (development_plan.md ↔ detailed_deployment_plan.md ↔ actual state)

#### 8.1 Items Marked in Plans as Needed — Status Now
- Phase tags: repository tagging per phase — Pending
- `.ebextensions/django.config` (WSGIPath) — Completed
- `.elasticbeanstalk/config.yml` tracked — Completed
- Container commands for `migrate` and `collectstatic` — Pending
- README: EB CLI version/profile info — Partially Documented (profile present, version not logged)
- Live URL in README — Completed
- Archived EB logs in `deployment_artifacts/` — Pending
- Default VPC check & Billing Alarm — Pending
- Environment variables table in README — Pending

#### 8.2 Tech Debt / Risks Called Out by Plans
- SQLite in EB is ephemeral; data loss across environment replacements — Mitigate by accepting for assignment or migrating to RDS (Task Sheet 2 scope dependent)
- Static assets may not be collected on each deploy — Add container commands
- Security hardening (`SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT`, cookie security) — Pending
- Monitoring/health and cost controls — Pending
